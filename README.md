ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JamesMcN4242.

I spend a lot of my time creating prototypes for games and software applications. 
I'm always interested to expand my knowledge base, whether that is through tinkering with projects, trying new languages, reading or something else entirely.
The public section of my GitHub will be filled with small weekend or time boxed projects. Essentially anything that grabs my interest that I want to work on within a defined time scale.

Feel free to reach out and say hi on Twitter: [@mcn_james](https://twitter.com/mcn_james)
